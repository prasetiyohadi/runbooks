## 1. Revenue Protection

### Prevent Catastrophic Breach Costs
- **Average Breach Cost**: $4.45M USD (2023 IBM report)
- **Recovery Costs**: Incident response, legal, forensics = $500K-2M
- **Notification Costs**: Legal requirement to notify affected customers
- **Regulatory Fines**: GDPR fines up to **4% of annual revenue** (or €20M maximum)
- **Remediation Costs**: Fix vulnerabilities + infrastructure hardening

**Business Impact**: Single breach can bankrupt small/mid-size company.

**Example**: 
- Company with 1M customer records breached
- Breach cost: $4.45M direct + $2M regulatory fines = **$6.45M loss**
- Lost revenue from customer churn: **$500K-2M additional**
- Total: **$6.95M-8.45M** impact (could exceed annual profit)

### Prevent Ransomware Impact
- **Average Ransom**: $500K-5M+ (many companies pay)
- **Downtime Costs**: Business halted during recovery = **$10K-100K+/hour**
- **Operational Recovery**: Restore systems, restore confidence = weeks/months
