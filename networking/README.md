# Networking

A comprehensive reference guide for cloud networking fundamentals and concepts.

## Contents

- [Networking Concepts & Reference Guide](./CONCEPT.md) — Core networking knowledge including VPCs, firewalls, routing, NAT, and CIDR ranges

## Overview

This section provides foundational knowledge for engineers working with cloud infrastructure. It covers essential networking concepts that apply across GCP, Azure, and other cloud platforms.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Networking Architecture** — Understanding how networks communicate
- **IP CIDR Ranges** — Calculating and working with network addresses
- **Routing** — How traffic flows through networks
- **Cloud Networking** — VPCs in GCP and VNets in Azure
- **Security** — Firewalls and Network Security Groups
